Greetings! I am Kevin Negron, a seasoned professional in the realm of statistical analysis, coding and mathematical modeling, dedicated to bringing a transformative approach to your business challenges. With a rich academic background and hands-on experience in leveraging data-driven methodologies, I am here to guide you through the complexities of statistical analysis and empower your decision-making processes.
## Unparalleled Expertise
My journey includes a Master's in Economics and Physics, coupled with a Bachelor's in Applied and Pure Mathematics. This unique blend of disciplines equips me with a holistic perspective to tackle intricate problems through the lens of statistical rigor and mathematical precision.
## Bridging Theory and Practice
Having served as a Statisticial specialist at Edwards Lifesciences, I honed my skills in developing theoretical frameworks and implementing sophisticated models. From navigating stochastic processes to crafting efficient statistical solutions, I am adept at transforming complex data into actionable insights. Moreover, I have work extensivly in developing design of experiments. Ranging from a manufacturing setting to test quality control, to developing suveys to asses the impact of a class, to asses the impact of ads on the companies revenue. I have worked with a myriad of client where their needs range from: developing a dashboard using DOMO and integrating ADP data, to developing a mathematical model and simulation for a binary star, to anaylzying data and automation.  
Some of the techniques I have used are: 
- Statistical Analysis
  - VAR, t-test, ANOVA, ANCOVA, traditional regression, logistic regression, MANOVA, MANCOVA, factor analysis, survival analysis, time series analysis, correlation analysis, chi-square test, meta-analysis, cluster analysis, and more advanced statistical techniques such as structural equation modeling (SEM), hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), and path analysis
- Mathematical Modeling
  - Stochastic modeling, Monte Carlo simulation, bayesian modeling, finite element methods, finite difference methods, spectral analysis, markov chains, Lagrange interpolation, eigenvalue problems, quadrature methods, FFT, Cooley-Tukey algorithm, Runge-Kutta methods, numerical quadrature methods

## Tailored Solutions for You
Whether you're seeking to optimize processes, enhance forecasting capabilities, or delve into intricate economic analyses, I offer bespoke consulting services designed to meet your specific needs. My proficiency spans languages such as MATLAB, Python, SPSS, JMP, Minitab, and R, ensuring a versatile toolkit to address a myriad of challenges.
## Client Success Stories
The accolades received for enhancing forecasting capabilities at the Woods Center for Economic Analysis and Forecasting and the successful implementation of statistical strategies and design of experiments at Edwards Lifesciences stand as testimonials to my commitment to delivering results.
