Hi there! I am pursuing higher education in pure and applied mathematics. My research interests are differential geometry, Riemannian geometry, PDEs, statistics, behavioral economics, quantum optics, numerical analysis, computation, and real analysis. Previously, I completed an MS in Physics and an MA in Economics from CSU Fullerton. My undergrad was in Applied Mathematics, Physics, and Pure Mathematics. Currently, I work as an instructor and as a consultant.

title: "[15] Signal Analysis (2023)"
excerpt: "This was research done to analyze the singal propagation of a 5G signal in a manufacturing enviroment. It included a report on the blockchain technology to asses the implementation of blockchain in a manufactoring setting alongside a 5G network. Futhermore, we develop ray-tracing model to analzye the propagation and blocakge of the 5G signal in a manufactoring setting.  *Pending publication*<br>
