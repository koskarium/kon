Hi there! I am pursuing higher education in pure and applied mathematics. My research interests are differential geometry, Riemannian geometry, PDEs, statistics, behavioral economics, quantum optics, numerical analysis, computation, and real analysis. Previously, I completed an MS in Physics and an MA in Economics from CSU Fullerton. My undergrad was in Applied Mathematics, Physics, and Pure Mathematics. Currently, I work as an instructor and as a consultant.
