title: "[15] Signal Analysis (2023)"
excerpt: "This was research done to analyze the signal propagation of a 5G signal in a manufacturing environment. It included a report on the blockchain technology to asses the implementation of blockchain in a manufacturing setting alongside a 5G network. Furthermore, we develop ray-tracing model to analyze the propagation and blockage of the 5G signal in a manufacturing setting.  *Pending publication*<br>

This came out of a consulting. In this we analyzed the smart manufacturing to see how it would be best to use 5G networks to move tremendous amount of information through blockchain technology. Furthermore, we develop ray-tracing model to analyze the propagation and blockage of the 5G signal in a manufacturing setting.
