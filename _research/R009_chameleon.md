This project was conducted under the supervision of Dr. Heidi Fearn. She worked as a consulting physicist and Mr. Glenn needed help in deriving certain equation in the literature. This was then passed down to me and I derive equations of motion from the action integral for a chameleon particle. Moreover, I make use of Mathematica to simulate the behaviour of these particles.
