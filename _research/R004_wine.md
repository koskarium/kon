title: "Analyzing Wine Auction Data for Price Anomaly (2015)"

affect on the winning bid price in the sequential period. <br>

This was my research project for CSU Fullertonâ€™s Econ 595 Reseach Capstone. In this project we look at wine auction data from 2014-2015 and test if the declining price anomaly is still present using R and Stata. To test, this I developed a model 
$$\log{Bid750}_{t+1}=\alpha+\beta_0{Size}_{t+1}+\beta_1{High Estimate750}_{t+1}+\beta_3 Qty_{t+1}$$
$$+\beta_4 Year_{t+1}+\beta_2{Low Estimate750}_{t+1}+\beta_5 Order_{t+1}+\epsilon_t$$
$$\quad+\beta_4 Year_{t+1}+\beta_2{Low Estimate750}_{t+1}+\beta_5 Order_{t+1}+\epsilon_t$$
$$\qquad+\beta_4 Year_{t+1}+\beta_2{Low Estimate750}_{t+1}+\beta_5 Order_{t+1}+\epsilon_t$$
$$\; +\beta_4 Year_{t+1}+\beta_2{Low Estimate750}_{t+1}+\beta_5 Order_{t+1}+\epsilon_t$$
