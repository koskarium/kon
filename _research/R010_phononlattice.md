This was my term paper for Phys 554 Solid State Physics. Phononic crystals are to sound what photonic crystals are to light and crystals are to electrons. A huge amount of application-driven research has been performed on photonic crystals, much less on phononic crystals, and almost nothing on phononic quasicrystals. In this paper, we explore a phonic 1D quasicrystal and its 2D tiling. We consider 1D lattice vibrations (phonons) for quasicrystal. Using a Fibonacci sequence, we construct an aperiodic self-similar lattice and from that sequence, we construct a 2D tilting.
