This was my research project for CSU Fullerton's Econ 590 Monetary Policy and Econ 505 Time Series. In this project, we look at the impact South Africa's switch to an inflation-based monetary policy post-2000. South Africa has the highest level of unemployment in G-20. The levels are close to those of the United States during the Great Depression. Much of this can be attributed to the lingering effects of the apartheid policies once pursued. In 2000, South Africa began to use inflation targeting monetary policy. Hence, it will be interesting to see how this change in policy affects the economy. To this end I develop a structured VAR model to analyze the effect of the change to a inflation targeting monetary policy regime in Eviews and R.
