This was my end of term project for CSU Fullerton’s Phys 481 Experimental Physics II. In this experiment, we investigated the damping of various materials using a shadow technique. We had a laser on one end and using a convex lens, converging so that we could have the laser hit both of the sensors. Once the laser hits the sensor, we clamp a flexible material in between the lens and the sensor. Then when we flick the material, the sensors will pick up when the laser is shining on it and when it is not. Thus if we connect it to an oscilloscope, we will get a signal that is on when the laser hits the diode and off when the shadow of the material covers the diode. From this, we will get an underdamp oscillation and we will do analysis on this.
