This paper uses a seven variable structured VAR (SVAR) to analyze the Mexican economy. The data is monthly data from January 1995 to April 2021, and we are using the Kim and Roubini specification as well as a Taylor Rule like specification for the Short Term Interest Rate equation. Furthermore, we restrict oil prices and exchange rate to see if there are any puzzles that are commonly discussed in the literature. Lastly, we set out to see if foreign monetary shocks affect domestic variables as well as which policy instrument plays a significant role in explaining the movement in the economics activities in Mexico. With that in mind we will use impulse response function and variance decomposition to analyze the relationship of the variables. Our empirical findings show that foreign shock do affect the domestic variables and that best domestic monetary policy variable that explains the movements in the Mexican economy is the short term interest rate.
